					<h2>HISTORY: Over 2,400 Years of Tradition</h2>
					<p>Systemization of apparently pre-existing elements of traditional Chinese wedding ceremony is generally credited to scholars of the <a href="http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/ancient2.html">Warring States period</a> , 402-221 B.C.Three venerable texts, <em>The Book of Rites</em>, <em>The Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial</em>, and the <em>Baihu Tong</em> outline the Three Covenants and the Six Rites, that were considered necessary elements of a marriage. However, the full ritual was so complicated that even within the span of the Warring States period, the etiquette underwent changes and simplification.                    </p>
					<p>What remained constant were the <a href="http://www.chcp.org/vobjectives.html">chief objectives</a>: joining and enhancing the two families and ensuring succession with numerous descendants. Reverence to parents and ancestors, omens to encourage fertility and wealth, financial and social obligations contracted by both families at the betrothal, extensive gift giving etiquette, and the bride&rsquo;s incorporation into her husband&rsquo;s family</strong> are recurring elements.</p>
					<p><strong>ANCIENT MARRIAGE CUSTOMS</strong></p>
					<p><strong>The Proposal</strong>                    </p>
					<p>The process began with an elaborate marriage proposal and acceptance. This process was placed in the hands of a go-between, who acted as a buffer between the two parties – a role similar to that of a real estate agent today. The important parties in proposal and betrothal negotiations were the parents of the prospective bride and groom, rather than the bride and groom themselves.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Marriage was for continuing the ancestral line and creating alliances between families –; too important a duty to be left in the rash hands of the young.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When the boy&rsquo;s parents identified a likely bride-to-be, they would send the go-between to present gifts to the girl&rsquo;s parents and to sound out their feelings about the match. If the proposal was well-received, the go-between would obtain the date and hour of the girl&rsquo;s birth recorded on a formal document.</p>
                    <p>The groom&rsquo;s family would place this document on the ancestral altar for three days. If no inauspicious omens, e.g. quarrels between the parents or a loss of property, took place within that time, the parents would give the information to a astrological expert to confirm that the young woman and their son would make a good match. If the boy&rsquo;s family found the horoscope to be favorable, they gave the boy&rsquo;s birth date and hour to the go-between to bring to the girl&rsquo;s family, who would go through the same process.</p>
                    <p>Only after both outcomes were favorable, would the two families arrange to meet. Finally face-to-face, each family evaluated the other in terms of appearance, education, character, and social position. If both were satisfied they would proceed to the betrothal.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p><strong>The Betrothal</a></strong></p>
                    <p>First both sets of parents exchanged family credentials as tokens of intention. Then, <strong>after extensive bargaining</strong>, the two families would arrive at the amount of money and goods that would make up the gift to the girl&rsquo;s family. After presenting <strong>engagement tokens</strong>, the go-between would ask the bride&rsquo;s family to chose among auspicious wedding dates suggested by the boy&rsquo;s family and also set a date for presenting betrothal gifts.</p>
                    <p><strong>The boy&rsquo;s family presented betrothal gifts </strong>of money and significant items such as tea, <strong>&quot;Dragon (male) and Phoenix (female)&quot;</strong> bridal cakes, pairs of male and female poultry, sweetmeats and sugar, wine and tobacco, accompanied by an itemized statement of these gifts. Tea was such a primary part of these gifts in some areas that they were known collectively as <em>cha-li</em>, that is, &quot;tea presents.&quot; The girl&rsquo;s family reciprocated with gifts of food and clothing.</p>
                    <p>It was customary for the girl&rsquo;s family to distribute the <strong>bridal cakes</strong> they received from the boy&rsquo;s family to friends and relatives as a form of announcement and invitation to the wedding feast. The number of cakes given to each was established according to a rigid etiquette, on the basis of seniority and degree of intimacy. Those who received the bridal cakes, were expected to present congratulatory gifts to the girl&rsquo;s parents.</p>
                    <p>The boy&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s gifts acknowledged the parents&rsquo; efforts in raising the girl, and <strong>by accepting the gifts, the girl&rsquo;s family pledged her to the boy&rsquo;s</strong>. It is interesting to note that the bride was given to the family rather than the groom alone. Although the bride and groom probably had not met yet, betrothal was considered binding unless both families agreed to annul the contract.</p>
                    <p>Several days after the presentation of the betrothal gifts, the girl&rsquo;s family sent porters with an inventoried <strong>dowry</strong> to the boy&rsquo;s house. The dowry consisted of practical items, including a chamber pot, filled for the occasion with fruit and strings of coins. This procession gave the girl&rsquo;s family the opportunity to display both their social status and their love for their daughter, and wealthy parents often included serving girls to attend their daughter in her new home.</p>
                    <p>Betrothals generally lasted for a year or two, although child betrothals would last until the children had grown to marriageable age.</p>
